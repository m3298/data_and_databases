Top 3 most common religions in the 10 poorest countries in the world

# This query starts by making a subquery that pulls out the 10 "poorest" countries, which I defined as having the lowest GDP--not necessarily the right way to do it. Then I attached all of the religions to that country and ordered by percentage. I did not isolate the top three, that would be a huge amount of extra work, and very advanced because you have to use a partition. So it would be a waste of time, but I did it anyway for very advanced users to see.

WITH poorest as(
SELECT country as country_name, gdp FROM economy ORDER BY gdp LIMIT 10)
SELECT poorest.country_name, poorest.gdp, religion.name, religion.percentage
FROM poorest JOIN religion ON religion.country = poorest.country_name
ORDER BY gdp, religion.percentage DESC;


# ADVANCED METHOD:

WITH topthree as
(SELECT rank_filter.* FROM (
        SELECT religion.*, 
        rank() OVER (
            PARTITION BY country
            ORDER BY percentage DESC
        )
        FROM religion
        ORDER BY country, percentage DESC
    ) rank_filter WHERE RANK <= 3) 
 SELECT topthree.*, poorest.cn, poorest.gdp
 FROM (SELECT country as cn, gdp FROM economy ORDER BY gdp LIMIT 10) as poorest
 JOIN topthree ON topthree.country = poorest.cn
 ORDER by poorest.gdp, topthree.percentage;
