Which countries share the longest border? 
# This is a good example of a triple join.

SELECT borders.country1, c1.name, c2.name, 
borders.country2, borders.length
FROM borders JOIN country AS c1 
ON c1.code = borders.country1
JOIN country AS c2 
ON c2.code = borders.country2
ORDER BY borders.length DESC NULLS LAST;
